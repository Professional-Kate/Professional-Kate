ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kate! <br>
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding and software development! Coding has always been a passion for me but I never found the motivation to do it before, that changed though, now I have too much motivation and am learning too many languages to be healthy. Nevertheless, I am having a blast and loving every second of it :D <br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Python and Ethical Hacking <br>
